tiles = ["A", "B", "D", "E", "F", "I", "O", "R"]
words = ["DOG", "FRIDA", "GOOD", "FOOD", "RED", "BROWNIE"]

# 1. Write a function that takes the tiles array and one word from the words array and returns whether or not the word is valid.

# A valid word is a word that can be created with a given set of tiles. A tile can not be used more than once.
# For example, given the tiles above, "FRIDA" is a valid word but "BROWNIE" and "FOOD" are not.
